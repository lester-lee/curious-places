## Pin: Who Knows What Where‽


### Team
Alyssa Wang: Designer

Karl Böcker: Designer

Lester Lee: Designer

### Problem and Solution Overview
While it is possible to jot down a note about a cool thing you see in the wild, sometimes it can be hard to even know what to jot down. We think it should be easy to both articulate questions you want to ask and get answers to them. By taking advantage of other people’s knowledge, we can always be actively learning. Our solution is a mobile platform that centers around location-based information and curiosity satisfaction. The platform will allow users to collaboratively share information, either by asking or answering questions, based on specific locations.
