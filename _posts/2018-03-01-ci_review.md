title: Contextual Inquiry Review

### Summary of Key Findings
After performing two contextual inquiries with Williams students who self-identify as wanderers and extensive fly on the wall observations at the Clark museum we have developed significant insights into how we should proceed in our product development. From our two contextual inquiries we developed an understanding for what wanderers do when they are wandering, that is, what are they thinking about, who are they wandering with and what are they looking for. While the answers to these questions may differ between different people and even between different times that they venture outdoors, we believe that the insight we have gathered is important as it reveals how some people feel some of the time. In terms of actual takeaways the most critical insight that we developed was of the different headspaces that people are in when they are outside wandering. That is, sometimes they are looking for specific things, other things they are socializing and sometimes they are just looking to think. In order to be successful we believe that our product can cater to at least a few of these potential types of wandering.

### People Observed: Geocacher, Outdoorsy Student, Museum-goers
We performed contextual inquiries with two Williams Students, U1 and U2. U1 is a passionate geocacher and also a frequent wanderer. U2 is an amateur bird watcher and frequent wanderer who is passionate about all things outdoors.

Our contextual inquiry with U1 also began in upstairs Paresky Student Center where we started off with some basic questions about geocaching and why U1 finds it so appealing. By understanding why U1 is attracted to geocaching we were hoping to develop an understanding that we could utilize to implement the attractive aspects of geocaching into our app. An important insight from our meeting with U1 was that he finds technology distracting while he is wandering and geocaching and therefore avoids even bringing his cell phone with him. This is obviously somewhat of an obstacle for the introduction of our product as it will necessarily be tied to a cell phone.

Our contextual inquiry with U2 started in upstairs Paresky Student Center where we were introduced and asked some introductory questions. From these questions we gathered that U2 explores nature for many different reasons. Sometimes he wanders outside simply to think and make up his mind regarding something, other times he wanders to find specific locations. Developing an understanding for these different headspaces was an important component of our inquiry with U2 and we spent significant time trying to understand what he thought technology could contribute to his experience during these different ‘modes’ that he finds himself in. The main part of our contextual inquiry with U2 took place outdoors as we were walking around trying to understand exactly what it is that catches U2’s attention when he is outdoors and how those interactions could be enhanced through technology.

Our final investigation was a fly on the wall observation at the Clark. We chose to perform this observation as a museum is one location in which we could imagine our product being used extensively. By observing how people interact with certain museum spaces and information we will be able to get a better understanding for how we should design our application in order to make it appealing and useful for museum visitors. At the Clark we observed many different types of visitors, ranging from students to older couples and single visitors. However, the behaviors that we observed were not typically unique to a certain type of visitor. Some visitors tended to travel in logical circuits through the spaces, while others wandered more aimlessly. Levels of interest also varied, where some people read every piece of text and examined every artwork and others briefly glimpsed at the largest, flashiest pieces. Additionally, there were different levels of engagement, ranging from tours (virtual and not) to just sitting at one of the many sitting areas and engaging with the art minimally.

### High Level Themes

There are several themes that proved to be important when we performed our contextual analysis. One primary and overarching theme is how to combine exploring the outdoors with technology in a non-intrusive fashion. One of the students that we met with described how he avoids bringing his cell phone with him when he explores the outdoors as he feels that it functions as a distraction. A potentially important component of our product may therefore be that it provides a non-intrusive way to interact with the environment, and perhaps will not require you, as the user, to have your phone out at all times. This theme was also something that we observed during our fly on the wall observations. At the Clark visitors read information off of signs next to the artworks they are looking at. This prevents visitors from gathering information from the work while they are looking at it. When implementing our application we will therefore try to develop some way for museum visitors to learn or interact with the artwork in a fashion that is not more intrusive than looking at the information text next to the work and hopefully less intrusive.

A secondary theme that we faced during our contextual inquiries is the wide range of potential ‘pins’ that can be added in our product. During both our meetings with Williams students it became clear that they both had many varied interests and could imagine many different applications for our product. Examples of the varied interests that they mentioned are trees, birds, buildings, monuments amongst a much bigger set of potential points of interest. With this many possible ‘pins’ in our product, it is important that we develop a way to sort and filter these pins in a way that is intuitive and unobtrusive.

Another theme that we observed was active vs. passive searching. Both of the students that we performed contextual inquiries with engaged in both active and passive searching. Whether they were performing active or passive searching depended on what headspace they were in when they were wandering. Understanding of these different ‘modes’ that users may find themselves in is an important part of our product as we would hope to satisfy the needs of users who find themselves in any of the given ‘modes’.

### What do these themes suggest?
These themes suggest that while there is interest in our product, it is important that it is developed in a way where it is not considered intrusive to the user who is using it to explore the outdoors. Furthermore, these themes suggest that there is significant opportunity to develop our application in several different directions, ranging from bird watching to building exploration. This may be both a blessing and a curse.

### How did we identify them?
We identified these themes both through discussions with the two Williams students we met with but also through our fly on the wall observations at the Clark.

### Task Analysis
In general, the people who will be using the design are people who like to walk or wander, tourists and travelers, and other demographics that will be visiting multiple locations and are curious about what that location has to offer. This is a broad category because it is not limited by any obvious characteristics such as age or profession; rather, this is open to most people. Even if people are limited to a specific city, there are still many unique places to explore within that city. Likewise, in rural areas, there is plenty of geographical space to investigate, along with the features that occupy that space.

At present, these individuals tend to find questions while wandering. Answering such questions can come from Google searches, discussing with others in person or electronically, or involve giving up if there is no easy way to find an answer. Additionally, sometimes our users want to share things that they find, and can do so through social media, but this is difficult for people who want to unplug when exploring.

Tasks that are desired are simpler alternatives to the methods of question answering available at present. This can include easier identification of wildlife and structures, or having a guided tour to take people through places they are at without having to actively go looking for a tour.

The act of going about answering questions is learned differently from person to person; as we saw with the Clark visitors, some people opted for Google or reading the available information while others had conversations with other visitors and staff. There is no single standard and the task is very universal.

Likewise, these tasks are performed everywhere, from in the middle of the woods to inside institutions of higher learning. There is no location limitation to our design or users as of now.

The relationship between the person and data should be that of a community member and their community, similar to the relationship between a library patron and library.

The person’s other tools include Google, people in their personal circles (friends, family, etc.), and social media platforms. Some dedicated individuals may also have access to specific books or staff if the location is an institution.

People communicate with each other in our design by commenting on the same pin or through direct messaging.

Ideally, these tasks are performed as often as users want. There should be no limit to how frequently users search for information.

The tasks should be spontaneous and able to be completed quickly. There should be minimal delay, if any.

When things go wrong, users should be able to report when information is incorrect and find alternative sources. Additionally, there may be some limitation on where users can add information from or some user voting system to mitigate this issue.
