### Tasks
#### Share Photos and Videos
Fredrik is an avid hiker who loves finding beautiful natural features while outdoors.  However, what he likes even more than finding these things is sharing them with his friends. It is sometimes difficult for him to do so as his friends don’t always have time to come with him when he wants to wander. He currently sends photos to his friends via text messaging and Instagram, but he wishes he could bestow on them a more personal experience. Fredrik is looking for ways in which he can share even more about the locations that he finds with his friends without them being there with him.

#### Share Personal Creations
Kris is a student who enjoys reading and writing poetry in their free time. They find that they write best when they are outdoors, especially during times of extreme weather. They wish people could have a better understanding of how nature serves as their muse. One day during a thunderstorm, Kris watches lightning strike a tree and writes a poem about the incident. They attach their poem to the tree. In the future, people who see the tree will also be able to see the poem and learn about how it came to be.

#### Ask Detailed Questions
Taylor loves animals. She also enjoys biking and other outdoor oriented activities, and spends her free time going on hikes on the nearby trails. She is in the woods one day and hears a strange noise that she’s never heard before. Taylor isn’t sure what kind of animal this is, but is worried it might be dangerous or hurt. She uploads the sound, pictures of several animal tracks, her location, and her description of what she thinks might have happened. Someone sees her question and tells her that the source of the sound she heard is a crying badger.

#### Share Educational Information
Max is a resident biology teacher whose main field of interest is invasive species in his town. He doesn't have much time to talk about invasive species while he's teaching, but he knows that students and friends would love to have more information. While he can answer their questions, he wants to share his knowledge with even more people. On his way to work, he sees a vine and attaches information about how the species was brought into the area. Now people who see the vine will be aware of its status as an invasive species.

#### Hold Anonymous Discussions
Maria is an established painter and a local museum is holding a special exhibit to showcase some of her work. She goes to unveiling night, where there are mostly her biggest supporters. She knows that they would give her only biased feedback on what they think of her work, so she anonymously checks what other people feel about her exhibit. Maria also anonymously shares her own thoughts about her paintings with her viewers, but without influencing them with the knowledge that she is the creator. She enjoys seeing the honest opinions about her work.

#### Find Motivation to go Outdoors
Christina is not the most outdoorsy person. Nonetheless she is incredibly curious. She frequently feels that the reason that she does not venture outdoors more is that her sense of curiosity can’t be fulfilled just by walking around without the opportunity to learn more in depth about what she is seeing. Therefore, Christina is a big fan of museums. She is also quite competitive and would love to have a way for her outdoor adventures to be quantified and compared with others.


## Designs
### Mobile App
This design is a mobile app that focuses on the user’s experience while they are wandering or going about their daily life. The app will require use of the camera, location services, and potentially also microphone or speaker depending on which features the user is interested in. When the user reaches a location with information that they are interested in learning about, the device will send them some form of notification. This can be customized so users can choose to turn off all notifications, allow sound, allow vibrations, etc. Additionally, when a user finds something of interest to share, they can post media related to that thing under different categories and receive responses from others.

#### Task 1: Share Photos and Videos, Share Personal Creations
When a user finds something that they want to share, they can pull up the map and place a pin at their location. Then they can post a video, photo, sound bite, or creation and attach it to the location. They will have options for privacy and location accuracy--should this only be visible to friends, or public? Should people be able to see this within 10 feet of the location, or 50 feet?--so users can feel comfortable sharing personal information while still interacting with a greater online community.

#### Task 2: Find Motivation to Go Outdoors
This design employs a competitive mode to motivate exploration, where users can compete against each other in different difficulty modes to earn points. Points can come from distance traveled, posts shared, questions asked, questions answer, etc. There will be a leaderboard for individual categories or locations and for overall points, and depending on rank, users can earn in-app currency to spend on virtual badges that can be displayed on their profile.

#### Task 3: Ask Detailed Questions
When a user finds something that they are curious about, they have two options. First, they can pull up the map and place a pin, choosing to write a question and attaching media if desired. This is targeted at location specific questions, such as “What is this tree?” Secondly, they can specify a general question without a pin, which can appear in a separate Q&A feed. This option is targeted at users who are searching for things, i.e. “Where can I find this lizard in the southern US?” For both options, users will be able to tag topics and communities.

#### Task 4: Get Detailed Answers
Answers come from two sources, general information on the internet, and other users. Information from the internet will be displayed when a user tags topics in their question, which will take them to different verified websites. Other users can post comments in response to a question, and there will be a voting system in place to weed out good answers from bad ones. Users will be notified when they receive an answer.

### Smartwatch
This design is an application for a smartwatch. It will take advantage of the location services that a smartwatch offers as well as the ability of the watch to pair with a smartphone which can play audio to the user. This app can perform several of the tasks that we have developed such as the experience of stumbling onto information and the ability to see or hear information about a specific location. The smartwatch app will also enable people to share what they are seeing with other people through the recording of audio messages or quick sketches.

#### Task 1: Sharing educational information
When a user stumbles upon a pin placed by another user their smartwatch will vibrate and ping to alert the user to the fact that they have stumbled upon a pin. They can then choose to have the information read out to them through earphones (reading information is not enabled given the very limited size of the screen on a smartwatch). This feature of stumbling on pins will not only be enabled for educational information but if another user has left a voice memo or some other audio message at a location other users can also stumbleupon that information in the below fashion.

#### Task 2: Get Questions Answered
When walking around a location the smartwatch app can prompt the user to answer a simple multiple choice question about a location that another user has posted. The answer to this question will then be shared with other users when they walk around this location. Given the limited screen size on smartwatches the questions will be limited to multiple choice questions. If a user is registered as an expert on a specific topic their answers will also be given priority in the feed of information in the app.

#### Task 3: Find Motivation to go Outdoors
The smartwatch app we are designing would utilize the step counting featured in most smartwatches to motivate users to venture outside and walk around. This motivation could also utilize features such as only making certain pins available to users who have taken a certain number of steps. The app can also remind the user at certain points during the day that they should be going outdoors in order to meet daily step targets.
![Task Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design_review/karl_3.jpg)

#### Task 4: Share Personal Creations
The smartwatch app we are designing would be able to record a users speech or singing and then pin it to a certain location and then allow other users to listen to their creations when visiting that location. These audio clips could also be categorized into various categories such as, music, educational information and poetry. A user will also be able to draw quick sketches on the smartphone which they can share in a similar fashion.

### Desktop
This design is a desktop application meant for detailed reviewing of Pins and exploring Pins from the comforts of home. The main focus is being able to explore the platform at the user’s own pace. It is not meant to be a standalone platform; rather, it will be paired with mobile platforms, such as a smartwatch or mobile phone.

#### Task 1: Hold Anonymous Discussions
The user can view nearby Pins, as well as Pins that the user has submitted. Each Pin is associated with a thread of comments that the user can reply to. The identity of each user can be revealed depending on each user’s discretion.
![Task Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design_review/lester_task1.png)

#### Task 2: Find Motivation to go Outdoors
The user can browse nearby Pins that interest them. Additionally, our design can keep track of which Pins the user looks at and when, and then begin to suggest Pins that we think the user would want to view in person. Users can also view and submit curated tours of Pins that other users can follow.
![Task Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design_review/lester_task2.png)

#### Task 3: Share Educational Information
The user can provide more detailed explanations of Pins with the luxuries of a desktop application, such as a keyboard and bigger screen real estate. The user will also have access to more resources than when they are out and about. For example, the user might have a textbook on architecture with fun facts that they might want to upload so that people who visit the Pin will see this information.
![Task Image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design_review/lester_task3.png)

#### Task 4: Share Personal Creations
The user can share creations that were made with the resources of home. The user will still be able to Pin their creations to where they want, but they also have the freedom to take their time perfecting their work. Users will also be able to view other creations, as well as any comments on their own.
