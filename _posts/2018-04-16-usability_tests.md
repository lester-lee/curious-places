title: Usability Testing Review
---
## Discussion
All three usability tests were conducted on Williams students with limited experience in interface design. We chose these participants because our primary stakeholders are college age students that either already frequently use mobile apps or are welcome to the idea of using their phones while outdoors. Our design is meant to be used outdoors and under different weather conditions, but it would be very difficult to replicate such an environment using a paper prototype. Thus, we decided to conduct the usability testings in quiet, distraction-free settings: the first one in Paresky Center, and the latter ones in Eco Cafe. These settings allowed the user to concentrate purely on the design in front of them.
The structure of the three usability tests remained the same. The user was given a brief description of our app and told to imagine walking outdoors. The user was then asked to create a Pin and attach a media file. Afterward, the user was asked to leave a comment on an already existing Pin. The first test was conducted by Karl, who acted as the human computer and facilitator. The latter tests were conducted by Lester as facilitator and Alyssa as the human computer.
We made several revisions in our process and prototype over the course of our testing. We added to and elaborated on our initial descriptions, since users seemed unsure of what the app was designed for. We also added help screens and back buttons, since our main issue was that users found themselves stuck and confused about the purpose of their task. We got better at conducting usability tests!

## Revisions
One salient and important modification to our paper prototype is adding back buttons! This modification is very important because users were confused about the navigational structure of our design, and this confusion could easily have led to . We had originally planned for users to leave a screen by tapping the background or another screen, but our usability tests showed that this action is not intuitive. Adding back buttons allowed users to feel more comfortable navigating our design.
