### Design Choice
From our contextual inquiries and data, we learned that users want to have control over the technology they use, and that they prefer unobtrusive designs. We also learned that most questions arise while they are outdoors. Our mobile design will allow users to use the app when they want to, such as when spontaneous questions come up or when they would like to know more about the area theyâ€™re in. They will simply be able to pull out their phone and use our app.  A mobile app will also stay out of sight and out of mind when users would like to be more present in their environment. Users can browse through Pins or check answers to their questions at home, rather than while they are outdoors. The two tasks that our design will focus on are asking questions and answering questions. These two tasks allow a user to ask a question about things in the environment they are interested in, and also to answer questions about topics that they are knowledgeable about. The combination of these two tasks are fundamental to how we envision users will use our app.
