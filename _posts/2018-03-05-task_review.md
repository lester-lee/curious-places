### Share Photos and Videos
Fredrik is an avid hiker who loves finding beautiful natural features while outdoors.  However, what he likes even more than finding these things is sharing them with his friends. It is sometimes difficult for him to do so as his friends don’t always have time to come with him when he wants to wander. He currently sends photos to his friends via text messaging and Instagram, but he wishes he could bestow on them a more personal experience. Fredrik is looking for ways in which he can share even more about the locations that he finds with his friends without them being there with him.

### Share Personal Creations

### Hold Anonymous Discussions

### Find Motivation to go Outdoors
Christina is not the most outdoorsy person. Nonetheless she is incredibly curious. She frequently feels that the reason that she does not venture outdoors more is that her sense of curiosity can’t be fulfilled just by walking around without the opportunity to learn more in depth about what she is seeing. Therefore, Christina is a big fan of museums. She is also quite competitive and would love to have a way for her outdoor adventures to be quantified and compared with others.
